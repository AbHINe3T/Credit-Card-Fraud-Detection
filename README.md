# Credit Card Fraud Detection 
 Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions.  In this project, that is exactly what I have done. Using a dataset of nearly 150k credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.  In this project, we will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:  * Local Outlier Factor (LOF) * Isolation Forest Algorithm.
